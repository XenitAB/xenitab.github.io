It's been ten years since the first presentation of this methodology. Despite the criticism that it is only applicable to Heroku and similar webapp services, it remains a relevant yard stick for software-as-a-service development. Some of its tenets have been incorporated into Docker and thence into OCI, effectively making them the law of container-land.
